MC-AIXI
=======

A Clojure implementation of Veness et alia's MC-AIXI approximation to Marcus Hutter's AIXI.

The 2011 paper is [here](http://jair.org/papers/paper3125.html), based on [Hutter 2007](http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm).

Much credit to [David Dalrymple](http://davidad.org/), who is appallingly intelligent, and without whom I'm sure I would never have gotten through the math.
